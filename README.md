# 🗃️ Library of Gnosis (My Zettelkasten)

Hey there! Welcome to my personal Obsidian vault, the **Library of Gnosis**. This is my digital space where I store all my notes, ideas, and discoveries. As a full-stack web developer, most of the content you'll find here is tech-centric—think programming tips, frameworks, cool libraries, and much more. But I also wander into other topics that pique my interest, from philosophy to random science facts!

## 📝 What's Inside?

Here’s a glimpse of what you’ll find in this vault:

- **📚 Literature Notes**: Summaries, insights, and reflections from books, articles, and other resources I've read or watched.
- **🛠️ Technology and Development**: Code snippets, language-specific notes, tools, libraries, and everything you need to build stuff!
- **🌐 Web Development**: Everything related to web development, including front-end frameworks, back-end tools, and full-stack techniques.
- **💡 Ideas and Projects**: My personal brainstorming hub, where future project ideas and half-baked concepts reside.
- **🔍 Curiosities**: A collection of notes on various topics that catch my eye, like philosophy, science, or anything else interesting.
- **🗃️ Unsorted**: Notes that haven't found their permanent home yet. This is my "inbox" for capturing new ideas.

## 🧠 Why Zettelkasten?

I'm using the Zettelkasten method to build a personal knowledge hub. It’s a way of linking ideas together, helping me see connections between different concepts and topics. This method makes it easier to explore, learn, and build a deeper understanding of whatever I’m working on—whether it's a new JavaScript framework or the latest book I'm reading.

## 🔧 Tools I’m Using

- **Obsidian**: My primary app for taking notes, leveraging Markdown and plugins for powerful organization.
- **Plugins**: Essentials like Dataview for dynamic views and Templater for consistent note-taking.
- **GitHub**: For version control and backup. You’re looking at it now!

## 🤷‍♂️ Who's This For?

Primarily, it’s for me to keep track of my learning and growth. But if you find something useful or interesting, feel free to explore and take whatever insights you need!
