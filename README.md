# 🗃️ Library of Gnosis (My  Zettelkasten)

Hey there! Welcome to my personal Obsidian vault. This is where I keep all my notes, ideas, and the cool stuff I find along the way. As a full-stack web developer, you'll find lots of tech-related content here—think books, frameworks, coding tips, and new tools. But I also jot down thoughts on other topics that catch my interest.

## 📝 What's Inside?

Here’s a quick rundown of what you’ll find:

- **Tech Notes**: Code snippets, guides, tutorials, and links to useful libraries and tools.
- **Books & Resources**: Summaries, key takeaways, and thoughts on books, articles, and other resources.
- **Web Dev Stuff**: Front-end, back-end, and everything in between. If it’s related to web development, it’s here.
- **Miscellaneous**: Notes on anything else that interests me—random thoughts, ideas for future projects, or cool things I come across.

## 🧠 Why Zettelkasten?

I'm using the Zettelkasten method to build a personal knowledge hub. It’s basically a way to link ideas together, making it easier to connect the dots and build a deeper understanding of whatever I’m working on.

## 🔧 Tools I’m Using

- **Obsidian**: My go-to app for taking and organizing notes in Markdown.
- **Plugins**: A few essential ones like Dataview and Templater to make life easier.
- **GitHub**: Keeping it all backed up and version-controlled.

## 🤷‍♂️ Who's This For?

Mainly, it’s for me to keep track of what I’m learning and thinking about. But if you find anything useful, feel free to dig in!
