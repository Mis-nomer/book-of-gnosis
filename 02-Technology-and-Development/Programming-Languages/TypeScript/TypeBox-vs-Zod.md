## Overview

The article, "Zod is amazing. Here‚Äôs why we're also using TypeBox," explains the reasons for using TypeBox instead of Zod, two popular TypeScript libraries for runtime schema validation. It highlights the strengths of each library and scenarios where one might be more beneficial than the other.

## Key Points

- **Zod Strengths**:
  - User-friendly API and syntax.
  - Great for most validation use cases.
- **Why TypeBox?**:
  - Provides better TypeScript integration and type inference.
  - Faster performance due to the way it handles types (JSON Schema).
  - Generate default value for object. How cool is that?
  - Again, JSON Schema. Don't have an use for them yet, but still, if it's fast I'll take it (*Please forgive my junior mentality)

## Personal Reflections

The notoriety of Zod's performance is nothing new but its ease of use and reliability make me want to stick around for a few more project. Like the author of Arktype's said, "Validator performance is mostly negligible in ~95% of situations and Zod‚Äôs is totally reasonable". 
But, it's up to personal experience and probably team agreement on whether or not TypeBox should be picked for the next project.
